# @pbrgld/Loggify

Loggify is a fast, zero-dependency logging library built for modern JavaScript and TypeScript runtimes – especially fun with Bun.js!

Designed for developers who want more expressive and structured logs without sacrificing performance, loggify brings a fresh logging experience using styled output, emoji-enhanced messages, and flushable contextual logs that keep related information together.

## 🚀 Features

- ⚡ **Zero dependencies** – lightweight and fast by design
- 🧵 **Context-aware logging** – group related logs and flush them together
- 🖨️ **Uses stdout instead of console.log** – for faster, cleaner output
- 🎨 **Styled text output** – control colors, formatting, and visibility
- 🕵️ **Caller info support** – trace logs back to where they were triggered
- 🕒 **Customizable timestamps** – add or remove as needed
- 😎 **Emoji-based or text-based tags** – switch as you like
- 🔧 **Built to play nicely with Bun.js** – but works with Node.js too!

## 🧭 Project Philosophy & Community Focus

This is the **first package** I’m sharing with the community – and it’s something I deeply care about.
With **Loggify**, my goal is to create a logging tool that helps developers stay focused, informed, and productive – especially when working on complex projects with asynchronous processes and nested dependencies.

Logging is not just a technical feature – it’s a **developer’s compass** in growing codebases.
When things get messy, good logs can mean the difference between clarity and chaos.

That’s why **Loggify** focuses on:

- ✅ **Simplicity** – clear API, no unnecessary complexity
- 🚀 **Performance** – using stdout, no dependencies
- 💡 **Developer Experience** – styled, structured, and readable logs
- 🔁 **General-purpose use cases** – helpful in any project context
- 🤝 **Community-driven development** – your input matters!

If **Loggify** helps you solve a problem, I’d love to hear about it – and I’m happy to support others in turning their ideas into reality. Let’s build something useful together.

### 🗺️ Roadmap – What’s Next for Loggify

Loggify is just getting started, and there are exciting features on the horizon!  
The following improvements are planned to make Loggify even more powerful and flexible for all kinds of environments and use cases.

#### ✅ Planned Features

1. **🌐 Browser Support**  
   Currently, Loggify is optimized for **Node.js** and **Bun.js** environments.  
   Future versions will bring compatibility with modern browsers and frontend workflows.

2. **🎨 Custom Style Templates (Tag-Based)**  
   Instead of manually setting styles like `color` or `bold`, you’ll be able to use **semantic tags** like `[style:file]`, `[style:warning]`, etc.  
   These tags will map to custom-defined style presets – making your logging both cleaner and more expressive.
